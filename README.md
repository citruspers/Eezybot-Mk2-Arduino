# Eezybot-Mk2-Arduino
Code and diagram for controlling the Eezybot mk2 using an Arduino and some basic components

Scope/target audience: Let's say you've just printed your eezybot and wish to write some code to control it. This will hopefully be a good starting point.

Requirements:

1x Arduino (I used the Uno)
3x potmeter
1x 1kOhm resistor
1x button
1x SG90 servo motor
3x MG995 Servo
1x breadboard
Plenty of dupont leads
External power supply capable of 5v2A at the very least
